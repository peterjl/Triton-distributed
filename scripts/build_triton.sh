# Build the upstream Triton that Triton-distributed's out-of-tree plugin loads
# against. The 3rdparty/triton submodule tracks github.com/triton-lang/triton
# (NOT a fork). Customizations are kept to the absolute minimum:
#   1. TRITON_EXT_ENABLED=1  -> build libtriton.so with default visibility so the
#      plugin can resolve Triton/MLIR/LLVM symbols at load time (upstream feature,
#      PR #9922). Stock pip wheels are hidden-visibility and cannot host plugins.
#   2. a linker version-script (triton_hide_libstdcxx.map) -> localize libtriton's
#      incidental libstdc++ symbols so they cannot interpose torch's incompatible
#      ones (see that file's header for the full rationale).
#   3. Minimal, op-agnostic source patches under plugin/patches/*.patch, applied
#      in lexical order. Each adds a generic extension hook that genuinely cannot
#      be expressed via the plugin mechanism (triton references no distributed
#      types); see docs/refactor/INTRUSIVE_REMOVAL_MAP.md and the plugin-side
#      consumers:
#        0001-axisinfo-visitor-hook        -> AxisInfo visitor registration. The
#          built-in Coalesce / load-store vectorization passes build
#          ModuleAxisInfoAnalysis with NO callback, so there is no out-of-tree way
#          to teach AxisInfo that the distributed pointer-preserving ops (symm_at /
#          consume_token) keep their operand's alignment/contiguity; without it
#          those loads/stores are not vectorized (a real perf regression).
#          Consumer: plugin/lib/AxisInfoVisitors.cpp.
#        0002-pipeliner-predicate-hook     -> software-pipeliner predication
#          registration. triton::predicateOp hard-codes the built-in ops and
#          report_fatal_error()s on any other registered op, so a distributed.wait
#          moved into a pipelined loop's prologue/epilogue would crash; the hook
#          lets the plugin predicate it (set its optional `pred` operand).
#          Consumer: plugin/lib/PipelinerPredication.cpp.
