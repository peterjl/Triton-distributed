# Fail the build here if the staged bitcode is ABI-incompatible with the AMD
# fused-MoE path, so the breakage surfaces now instead of at kernel-compile time.
# Two representative symbols are checked:
#
#   mori_shmem_putmem_nbi_signal_block
#     A cooperative block-scope put-with-signal. It stands in for the whole family
#     of warp/block SHMEM primitives the fused-MoE kernels link against. Older MORI
#     only exported thread-scope wrappers, so this symbol was absent -- that was the
#     original build breakage this update fixes.
#
#   _ZN4mori5shmem15globalGpuStatesE  (== mori::shmem::globalGpuStates)
#     A device global holding this GPU's SHMEM runtime state (PE id, peer pointer
#     table, symmetric-heap base, transport info); every mori_shmem_* device fn
#     reads it. Triton compiles each kernel into its own HIP module, so each module
#     that links this bitcode gets its OWN copy of the symbol, zero-initialized.
#     jit.py's post-compile hook copies the host-initialized GpuStates into it via
#     shmem_module_init(). If the symbol is missing that init has nowhere to land;
#     it must also be a strong definition (not weak/declared) or the host state
#     lands on the wrong instance and device reads see garbage peer pointers.
